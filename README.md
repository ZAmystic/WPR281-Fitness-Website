## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Navigation**: Use the responsive navbar to switch between pages like Home, Workout Logger, Goals, Dashboard, and Quotes.
2. **Logging Workouts**: Input exercise details (type, duration, calories, date) on the logger page; entries appear in a dynamic list with print options.
3. **Setting Goals**: Select predefined goals on the goals page; track via progress bars that update automatically based on logged data.
4. **Dashboard Visualization**: View charts that pull from your logs to display daily/weekly metrics.
5. **Authentication**: Mock login/registration forms pop up for simulated user sessions (ready for backend auth).
6. **Motivation Boost**: Generate random quotes on-demand for instant inspiration.

All data is handled locally via JavaScript for privacy and speed, with potential for cloud syncing in future updates.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Workout Logger**: Capture daily sessions with details on exercise type, duration, calories burned, and timestamps. View a scrollable log and print summaries for offline records.
